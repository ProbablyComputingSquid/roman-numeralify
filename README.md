# roman-numeralify
converts decimal numbers into roman numerals.<br>
Supports numbers, with commas, up to 1,399,999 <br>
<br>
some of the functionality depends on ANSI terminal overline, if it fails, replace overline with the unicode combining overline (‾ or ◌̅) which is kind of cursed, but it (mostly) works
