# roman-numeralify
converts decimal numbers into roman numerals.<br>
notice - there is an upper bound to how far it will go.<br>
some of the functionality depends on ANSI terminal overline, if it fails, replace overline with the unicode combining overline (‾ or ◌̅) which is kind of cursed, but it (mostly) works
